## Overview

It's a simple challenge. It's only needed some HTML5 e CSS3 knowledge to get it done. It challenges you to put a QR Code and some text centered on the screen and to make it responsive for a screen width of 375px and 1440px. The designs that must be followed are found inside the design folder.

## My process

I started by making the HTML5 part. I wrote the code on one div divided on an img, an h2 header and a paragraph. I kept the div that came with the project and put it on the lower part of the screen. After that I went to the CSS3 part to put the styles requested, and followed the information sent on the `style-guide.md` file. In this part I used a Mobile-first workflow, but then I realized there was no difference between the designs given as models, besides the size of the screen. So I kept only one style for both of the screens.

On a previous version of this code I got some really good suggestions in respect to web accessibility from Melvin Aguilar (MelvinAguilar on GitHub). I put them on practice and made some changes on the code.
